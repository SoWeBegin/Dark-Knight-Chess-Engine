Simple chess engine which uses a Mailbox board representation, based on the well known chess engine VICE. 
Currently uses Stockfish' NNUE as the only evaluation, which was implemented thanks to a library (https://github.com/dshawul/nnue-probe) by dshawul.
There are many missing features such as transposition tables; this engine is in no way meant to be taken seriously as it is just a hobby project.

Current strength is about ~2550 ELO (mostly thanks to Stockfish NNUE).
